        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the section of their choice. Below the navigation bar, is a video background that gives a good sense of communication.
        2. The full aspect of the website is shown by the image which just stands out and puts across the actual idea of the website.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. The content on the page is appropriately placed so as to give a good visual feedback to the user.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, an alert shows up stating that their submission was a success.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and services section, they will move on to the Testimonials section which give the users an understanding of what our esteemed clients think of us.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer which have a slow transition when hovered over.
        3. When clicked, the user is directed to the respective homepage of that site.
        4. There is a 'Trips' section in the navigation bar which when clicked, will take the user to the trips page.
        5. Here, the user will get the flight details such as origin, destination, departure date, flight and the price.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals
   
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Instagram page.
